MazeMaster MVP Specification
1. Purpose
The purpose of MazeMaster is to provide users with an engaging platform to generate, solve, and explore mazes. The MVP will focus on core functionalities including maze generation, manual solving, automatic solving, and basic user interface.
2. Target Audience
Puzzle enthusiasts.
Educators and students interested in algorithms and problem-solving.
Casual gamers looking for a mental challenge.
3. Core Features
3.1 User Interface
Homepage: Welcome screen with options to generate a maze, solve a maze, and view instructions.
Maze Display: Visual representation of the maze grid where users can interact with the maze.
3.2 Maze Generation
Generate Maze: Users can generate a maze with the following options:
Grid size (e.g., 10x10, 20x20).
Maze complexity (simple, moderate, complex).
Random Seed: Option to generate mazes based on a random seed for reproducibility.
3.3 Manual Maze Solving
Navigate Maze: Users can manually navigate through the maze using arrow keys or on-screen controls.
Start and End Points: Clearly marked start and end points.
Path Highlighting: Visual indication of the path taken by the user.
3.4 Automatic Maze Solving
Solve Maze: Option to automatically solve the generated maze using algorithms like:
Depth-First Search (DFS).
Breadth-First Search (BFS).
Solution Path Display: Visual representation of the solution path.
3.5 Instructions and Help
How to Play: Instructions on how to navigate and solve mazes.
Algorithm Explanation: Basic explanation of the maze-solving algorithms used.
4. User Interface Design
4.1 Homepage
Buttons: "Generate Maze," "Solve Maze," and "Instructions."
Simple Layout: Intuitive and easy-to-navigate interface.
4.2 Maze Screen
Maze Grid: Display of the maze with interactive elements.
Controls: Arrow keys for navigation, on-screen buttons for touch devices.
Indicators: Start and end points, current position of the user.
4.3 Solution Screen
Solution Path: Highlighted path showing the solution.
Algorithm Choice: Dropdown to select the solving algorithm.
4.4 Architecture

Backend
Framework: Node.js with Express for server-side logic.
Algorithms: Implementation of DFS and BFS for maze-solving.
Frontend
Framework: React for building interactive user interfaces.
State Management: Redux or Context API for state management.
Hosting
Platform: AWS or Heroku for hosting the application.

Security
Basic security for user interactions (no sensitive data handled in MVP).
 Performance
The system should generate and solve mazes of up to 50x50 grid size efficiently.
Average response time for maze generation and solving should be under 2 seconds.
Scalability
Considerations for scaling the application to support more complex mazes and higher user loads in future versions.
Usability
Intuitive and responsive design for both desktop and mobile users.
Accessibility features for visually impaired users.
7. User Stories
1. As a user, I want to generate a maze with specific parameters so that I can have a customized puzzle experience.
2. As a user, I want to manually navigate through a maze using intuitive controls so that I can solve it interactively.
3. As a user, I want to see the solution path generated by an algorithm so that I can learn how to solve the maze.
4. As a user, I want to save my progress and comments on a maze so that I can continue solving it later and share my thoughts with others.
5. As a user, I want to receive email notifications when someone comments on my maze so that I stay engaged with the community.
